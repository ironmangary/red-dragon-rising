        The cobbled streets hum with the rhythm of daily life. Merchants hawk their wares from stalls draped in rich fabrics, the scent of roasted meats mingling with the crisp bite of morning air. A towering fountain stands at the centerâ€”its worn stone whispering tales of ancient rulers and forgotten legends. The laughter of children mixes with the murmurs of traders, and somewhere, a bard plucks a lively tune.
