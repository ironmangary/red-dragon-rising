# Red Dragon Rising

## Overview
*Red Dragon Rising* is a Python-powered RPG using PyWebIO for its interactive interface. A modern remake and tribute to *Legend of the Red Dragon* (LORD), the classic 90s BBS door game created by Seth Able Robinson, it blends nostalgic charm with fresh mechanics. Players embark on a journey through a rich fantasy world, creating their characters, exploring, and battling formidable enemies.
